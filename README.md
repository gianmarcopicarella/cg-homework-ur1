# Extra credit (Watercolor painting effect)
In addition, I developed an extra feature which turns a picture into a painting. [Here](https://github.com/gianmarcopicarella/CS-Computer-graphics-class-homework/blob/master/ImageManipulation/libs/yocto_grade/yocto_grade.cpp) you can find my implementation.
